# ===================================================================
# Quality Tracker Frontend Environment Configuration
# ===================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: For production deployments, these environment variables
# are ONLY needed for local development. In production, the frontend
# automatically detects the server hostname and uses:
#   http://<server-hostname>/api
#
# This means you DON'T need to set VITE_API_URL in production builds.
# The application will automatically use the correct URL based on
# where it's deployed.
# ===================================================================

# Production Server IP - Change this to your actual server IP
REACT_APP_PRODUCTION_SERVER_IP=your_server_ip

# Backend Feature Control (optional - defaults to true)
REACT_APP_BACKEND_ENABLED=true

# API URLs (for local development only)
# Vite uses VITE_ prefix
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3002

# For development/local testing
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3002

# Webhook Server (existing - for test execution)
REACT_APP_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3001
